          "Exceptional mobility with built-in dodge mechanics and qi shield generation",

Unlike most weapons that require skill theft or quest completion, this weapon is granted immediately upon character creation. To equip it, open your inventory menu, navigate to the Martial Arts section, and select it as your primary weapon. It pairs exceptionally well with the Nameless Spear for a balanced DPS build, or with the Strategic Sword for advanced bleed-focused compositions. No prerequisites, Dragon Keys, or faction reputation are required, making it a core part of every early-game loadout.",

            "a": "Its S-Tier ranking comes from unmatched versatility and scalability. The sword's qi shield provides temporary protection against qi damage, its movement skills allow weaving in and out of danger, and its posture break potential remains relevant even in late-game boss fights. Because its power scales strongly with player skill, it stays viable from level 1 to endgame raids without feeling outdated."

Many meta builds run both: use Strategic Sword during safe DPS windows and swap to Nameless Sword during high-pressure phases that require dodging, blocking and posture breaking. This weapon-swapping playstyle is extremely strong in both PvE and PvP."

From there you can start experimenting with its light combo chain, charge spin attack, and projectile deflection capabilities.

            "a": "When you enter the Unrivaled state by charging your spear spin, a defensive field forms around your character. While this spin persists, most incoming arrows, bolts and basic qi projectiles are automatically deflected. Because the spin also deals continuous damage, you can advance into enemy firing lines while staying relatively safe, making the weapon extremely strong against archer camps and ranged-heavy encounters."

            "a": "For general open-world PvE and early dungeons, Nameless Spear tends to be stronger due to its responsiveness, simpler combos and defensive spin. Heavenquaker Spear surpasses it when you focus on large group pulls and elite mob packs, thanks to stronger hard crowd control and AoE burst. Many players use Nameless Spear early on and transition into a Heavenquaker + sword combination once they unlock more advanced content."

Running them together lets you rotate: apply bleed stacks with Strategic Sword, then swap to Nameless Sword for survival and posture break while bleeds tick. This synergy is one of the strongest melee combinations in the current meta for both solo and group PvE."

In the final chamber, you will encounter the Heavenquaker master performing wide-swing drills. You must use Touch of Death to initiate a skill theft sequence while avoiding the sweeping spear arcs.

You can pull multiple enemies, group them up and unleash earth-shattering skills that both knock them down and deal high AoE damage. However, you must learn enemy patterns, since the long animations can leave you exposed if you whiff or overcommit into elite enemies."

Its knockdowns and staggers create safe damage windows for your main carries, while its large hitboxes ensure that debuffs and bleed effects apply to entire pulls. When paired with a dedicated healer and a main tank, Heavenquaker Spear turns chaotic trash packs into manageable encounters."

        "how_to_obtain": "Begin by equipping a basic Rope-Dart slot from your Martial Arts interface, even if you have no advanced style learned. This will trigger a guidance prompt pointing you toward the Nine Mortal Ways dojo in Kaifeng. Travel to the marked location and speak with the Rope-Dart instructor, who offers a tutorial quest. Complete a series of training tasks involving hitting distant targets, pulling enemies off ledges and comboing rope hits into melee strikes. After these drills, you gain the opportunity to perform Skill Theft on the master during a staged spar. Use Touch of Death when prompted and complete the theft mini-game to learn Mortal Rope-Dart. The entire questline is combat focused rather than stealth oriented, making it appealing for aggressive players who enjoy high-mobility gameplay.",

            "a": "It can be used as a primary weapon, but it truly shines as a partner to a strong melee option. Its rope pulls and gap closers are amazing for setting up melee combos, and its finishers are excellent for executing weakened enemies. Players looking for top-tier DPS should generally pair it with Infernal Twinblades or a high-damage sword, using Rope-Dart as an opener and control tool."

            "a": "In PvP, Mortal Rope-Dart can be extremely disruptive when mastered. Well-timed throws can drag opponents out of position, interrupt casts and punish reckless movement. However, missing key skills often leaves you exposed. It is a high-skill PvP option that rewards prediction, spacing and an understanding of enemy escape tools."

          "High burst damage through lightning-imbued slashes and combo finishers",
          "Applies shock-style debuffs that increase subsequent damage taken",

        "how_to_obtain": "To unlock Thundercry Blade, progress the mid-game storyline until you gain access to a storm-battered mountain path on the outskirts of Qinghe and Kaifeng. There you will find a ruined temple dedicated to lightning spirits. Clear out the bandits occupying the approach, then complete a short environmental puzzle involving activating lightning rods in a specific order during a thunderstorm. Once solved, a secret chamber opens beneath the temple where a reclusive swordsman practices Thundercry techniques. Speak with him to trigger a duel-style encounter. During the duel, survive his initial burst and wait for him to pause to recover; at that moment, trigger Touch of Death to attempt Skill Theft. Successfully completing the theft grants you Thundercry Blade, while failure forces you to either retry the duel or return after improving your gear.",

Nameless Sword, by contrast, delivers more consistent pressure with better defense and mobility. If you prefer explosive, cooldown-driven gameplay, Thundercry Blade will feel better. If you want a stable all-rounder, Nameless Sword remains superior."

Stack gear with lightning damage bonuses, skill damage and critical stats, then run Inner Ways that increase burst windows and energy regeneration. Pairing Thundercry Blade with a support like Soulshade Umbrella or Panacea Fan in group content further amplifies its ability to delete priority targets during coordinated damage phases."

Participate in his multi-stage trials, which include holding aggro on elite waves, protecting NPCs and surviving powerful boss assaults without letting your allies die. At the end of the trials, the veteran offers to teach you Stormbreaker Spear.

Its toolkit includes reliable taunts, damage reduction buffs and crowd control, allowing you to anchor enemy attention while your allies focus on DPS.

In solo play, it suits players who value consistency and dislike dying more than they value clear speed. Pair it with an offensive secondary weapon like Nameless Sword or Infernal Twinblades to speed up farming while retaining strong defensive tools."
