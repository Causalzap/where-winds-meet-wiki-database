## 📖 About The Project

**WWM Wiki** is a high-performance, open-source database designed to help players master the martial arts of the Northern Song Dynasty. Unlike generic wikis, we focus on **accurate data**, **hidden mechanics**, and **meta builds**.

Our goal is to provide detailed stats for every Martial Art, Weapon, and Armor set in the game, localized for global players (English, Chinese, French, Spanish, Vietnamese).

### 🌟 Key Features

* **🚀 Fast & Lightweight:** Built with [Astro](https://astro.build) for instant page loads.
* **🌍 Multi-Language Support:** Full localization for global Wuxia fans.
* **📊 Hard Data:** Exact damage scaling, cooldowns, and hidden poise damage values.
* **⚔️ Meta Analysis:** S-Tier rankings based on the latest game patches.
